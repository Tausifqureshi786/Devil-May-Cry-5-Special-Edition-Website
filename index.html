            <h2>Plot of the Game</h2>
            <p class="content">
                The game's story focuses on the player character Dante,
                a young drifter who secretly hunts demons, who live among 
                and rule over humans. Dante is a Nephilim, the child of an angel
                and a demon. He is reunited with Vergil, his twin brother,
                who enlists his help slaying powerful demons, culminating 
                in a fight against Mundus, the demon king who murdered Dante's 
                mother and condemned his father to eternal banishment and 
                suffering. Players can use Dante's iconic sword, Rebellion,
                and signature handguns, Ebony and Ivory, as well as
                a variety of other melee weapons and firearms to defeat enemies. 
                The game also introduces "Angel Mode" and "Demon Mode", which are
                modifiers to Dante's moveset.
